# Groups
by Lincoln Edsall, Benjamine Lampe

"Groups" is a custom collections framework designed from scratch for pedagogical purposes.

A "Group" in plain terms is a datatype that stores a group of elements, ranging from Sets, to Series (Lists), to Maps.
Groups can vary widely in their permitted behvaior and underlying representation.

All implementations are a work in progress, but usable (all implemented functionality varified for accuracy) Groups include:
1. ArraySeries (RandomAccess series of elements implemented with an auto-resizing array)
2. LinkedSeries (RandomAccess series of elements implemented with a doubly linked list)
3. BSTMap ((Key, Value) map, no repeated keys, implemented with a self balancing binary search tree)
